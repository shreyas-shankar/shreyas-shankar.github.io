            <h2>Drifting and Swimming <span id=blogpublished>Jan
                    2, 2021</span></h2>
            <p>I was placed in a raft on the river as a young child. It was a nice raft. A river raft. It was well
                built, sturdy and had all the comforts a child could want. The river took me along. The ride was easy. I
                rarely had to swim. The river carried me with surprising ease. I was not the only one on the river.
                There were others with me, floating down the river on their own rafts. They fell off the raft into the
                river and learnt to swim. Their rafts started leaking and they learnt to plug the holes. They didn't
                have enough food. They learnt to fish. Time passed and I found that I had grown up. The river became
                sluggish. People got out of their rafts and began to walk. I got out of my raft and joined them, albeit
                grudgingly. Why walk? The raft was nice. I hoped for another
                river. I liked the river. </p>
            <p>I found myself on a beach. In front of me was the vast blue ocean. The waves crashed into the beach like
                a
                hungry toddler trying to stuff his mouth with the fine sand. There were a lot of people on the beach.
                More
                people that I had ever known. "Where is the next river?", I asked the person standing near me. "There is
                no
                river. Just the ocean", he replied.
                "But, where am I supposed to go?"
                "Nowhere. And anywhere you want"</p>
            <p>
                I walked away from the mad man and tried to talk to another person. I could see people in groups walking
                about.
                They seemed content to remain in their groups. They all seemed to know where to go. I looked around.
                There was
                only one way out. The ocean was waiting.
            </p>

            <p>"What is on the other side?", I asked another person who was preparing to start their swim.
                "Nothing. And anything you want", came the reply.
                I looked about, confused. The ocean led nowhere and everywhere? It led to no destination and all
                destinations?
                How was that possible? Was I just supposed to swim? What if I drowned?</p>

            <p>
                At the same time some lights came on far out in the ocean. There was a cheer on the beach. Some had
                begun
                swimming a long time back. Some others started swimming as soon as the lights became visible. I started
                panicking. Do I just start swimming? What were those light? Were they the destinations?
            </p>

            <p>
                I ran into the water. The water was cold. My legs weren't used to running or swimming. I could barely
                get past
                the waves. Time and time again, the powerful waves pushed me back on to the shore. I looked about and
                saw people
                lying on the beach, tired and spent. These people had tried what I was also trying. Running to the water
                and
                trying to push through the waves with sheer energy. I could see that it was a bad idea.
            </p>

            <p>
                The people who floated down the river with me were long gone. Each one swimming to a destination far
                away. I
                felt alone. I felt scared. Is the beach where my journey ends? Do I never get to see what is on the
                other side
                of the ocean?
            </p>

            <p>
                I waited for help. "Please. Help me. I don't know how to swim. I don't know what to do", I begged the
                first
                person who seemed likely to help.

                "Where are you going? If you don't know, take the easiest path out to sea. Once there, your path will
                become
                clear". Where was I going? How was I supposed to know? Nobody had told me where to go.
            </p>

            <p>
                I waited. And watched. A lot of swimmers headed towards a pier that cut through the ocean. They walked
                across it
                and dove into the water. Of course! What a simple solution! An easy way to avoid the waves. I walked to
                the
                pier. There was a guard there. I was let through. The guard stopped almost everyone else. I had a
                ticket. I
                didn't know that I had one. I felt grateful that I had it. I felt sorry for the many who didn't. There
                were no
                tickets being sold anywhere. How did I get this?
            </p>

            <p>
                I jumped into the ocean and began to swim. I swam towards the bright lights. The swimming gradually
                became
                easier. Starting the swim was the toughest part. Gradually, my energy drained away. It was dark in the
                ocean. I
                needed to rest. In the middle of the ocean, there was a small island. The island was full of people.
                They were
                resting. Some were prepared to give up. They would stay on that island forever. When it was light again,
                I saw
                why many were prepared to give up. The waves on the island were even stronger than the waves on the
                beach. There
                was no pier. And on the other side of the waves - those mysterious lights.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had seen people cut down small trees and use the wood to float off the island, through the waves. I
                cut down a
                branch and waded into the waves, branch held tight. The branch floated and I floated with it. I was out
                in the
                ocean again. I used the branch to float when I was tired from swimming. Eventually, I reached the next
                island.
            </p>

            <p>
                There were fewer people here. The island was another paradise. The urge to stop the journey here was
                overwhelming. I did not want to brave another swim with just a branch for support. Then, something
                interesting
                caught my eye. A few people has used some vines to tie all their branches together into a raft. They
                stood on
                the raft as it floated on water. They waved to me. I added my branch to the raft and climbed aboard. My
                fellow
                travelers all had the same look in their eyes. Tired, but defiant. They all wanted to find the lights
                and
                nothing would stop them. I saw my reflection in the water. Surely, I don't deserve to be here on the
                raft with
                them. Look at their craft and guile. Look at their determination. I'm just going to be a burden. But I
                kept
                quiet, and tried to enjoy their company. Eventually, we sailed away. Onwards, to the next island.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the middle of the ocean, I asked if anyone knew what the final destination was. "It is wherever you
                want it
                to be", they replied in unison. There, in the middle of the ocean, with the moon and stars shining in
                all their
                glory, I realized what I was missing. There was no destination set for me anymore. I set the
                destination. I
                choose the path. I might have come this far by sheer chance, but from now on, but I didn't have to float
                along
                on this raft. I could go anywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                At that moment, the destination lights seemed to glow a little brighter, as if they were putting on a
                show just
                for me. I saw a destination that didn't seem to exist before. The lights caught my attention. I could
                see a
                current in the water leading me straight to it. It was time to jump off the raft.

                I looked at my fellow sailors. They seemed to know that my decision was made. "Beware. The swim to the
                destination is not as easy as it seems. It has challenges. It is a worthy path. Good luck", they said. I
                jumped
                in the water. The current dragged me away towards the lights. I swim on. I swim on.
