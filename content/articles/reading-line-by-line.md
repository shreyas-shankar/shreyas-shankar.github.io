I consider myself an avid reader. I read almost every day. When I'm not forced to read for work, I read for pleasure. I've often wondered if I'm a "good" reader. I have my fair share of bad reading habits and I want to talk about one particular habit that I've noticed recently.

At the best of times, I'm an impatient reader. If I'm reading fiction, I want to know what happens next. If I'm reading code documentation, I want to find what I want quickly. If I'm trying to read through all the code in a particular file, I find myself trying to skip sections of code altogether if I get a vague sense of what it is trying to do.

I can feel my primary school teachers tut-tutting as they read my admission above. I have broken all the unspoken rules of reading. I've blasphemed against the reading Gods. I can still hear my primary school English teacher droning on about reading "line by line". "Don't skip words. Don't skip sentences". I remember a few professors in undergrad echoing the same thoughts as we learned to read code and code documentation. "Read through the documentation. Don't skip lines of code".

I have to admit that my approach of skipping lines, paragraphs, and entire passages, has helped me in the past. I get through a book quicker. I skip the boring bits. I skip parts that make me uncomfortable and I generally get by with just enough understanding of what I'm trying to read. Surely, this can't have helped you at work, you may wonder. I would say that it has helped me. I have finished tasks quickly and my intuition has helped make up for the lack of detail.

Unfortunately, this approach is very quickly reaching its limit. I find myself at a point where not reading line by line is actively hurting me. I decided to take on a new challenge when I joined Clari. Everything changed. The coding language, the size of the company, the stakes of my work.
As I made this switch to working with Java instead of Python, to working with a well-established codebase instead of starting a new project, there was suddenly a need to absorb a lot of information within a very short amount of time. There were two approached that I could use. I could read through each file multiple times, only looking at what pieces of code were relevant at that time, or I could read through an entire file, even when there was no immediate need to go through the entire file.

For the first couple of weeks, I fell back to my natural state of flitting through files, but I found myself going through the same files over and over again. I wasn't really understanding anything and I found the entire approach very myopic. Sure, I'd learn enough to do that particular job, but I would have to invest as much time for the next task as well.

I had a similar realization about reading for pleasure as well. As I listened to the audiobook of The Eye of the World (narrated spectacularly by the wonderful duo of Michael Kramer and Kate Reading), I realized how much of the book I had skipped over when I first read the book. I enjoyed the audiobook immensely and found myself listening actively to the narrators.

The conclusion that I can draw from these experiences is that there is a lot of enjoyment and understanding to be gained from reading every line. More than just reading line by line, I think being focused and intentional while reading makes a difference. It's tougher to do this at work when every minute spent reading code/documentation that isn't necessary to solve the problem at hand adds to the delay in delivering the piece of work, but it helps build context and ultimately pays itself back down the line.

To all my teachers who told me to read line by line. You were right. I understand now.
