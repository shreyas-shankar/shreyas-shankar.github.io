Here is my situation. I have to switch jobs. To do this, I have to prepare for coding interviews. To do well in those coding interviews, I have to become comfortable solving the Hard questions on LeetCode. This dependency chain is daunting. What if I can't even solve problems of Medium difficulty on LeetCode? That means that I have no hope of solving Hard problems. If I can't solve the Hard problems then what hope do I have in these interviews?

I am quite hamstrung by this dependency chain. The reality is that I can't easily solve problems of Medium difficulty on LeetCode. I have never even attempted to look at the Hard problems because, what's the point? I can't even solve Medium problems so there is no point in attempting the Hard problems. 

To fix this conundrum, I had a foolproof plan. I will start studying algorithms again. No scratch that. I will start with data structures. Did you know that integers and floats are basic data types? By effectively redoing my entire undergrad, I was sure that I would gain the confidence to tackle the medium-difficulty problems on LeetCode. Surely, after all this work, I will be able to easily solve Medium difficulty problems. After that, I can start attempting the Hard problems. Surely, after redoing my undergrad and parts of my master's degree, I will not feel like an imposter when I begin to attempt a Hard problem. 

Now, this approach has problems. What if, after studying data structures and algorithms, I still struggle to solve problems on LeetCode? What if this doesn't prepare me for all the challenges posed by these coding interviews? Am I going to go back to High School to restore my shattered confidence? Am I going to feel any less of an imposter?

I had an epiphany the other day. Why am I even trying to "solve" those questions on LeetCode? My goal is not to become good at solving LeetCode problems. My goal is to do enough to get through the coding round of interviews. There is a lot more to these interviews than just the ability to write code. By building these dependency chains, I have somehow tied my self-esteem to my ability to solve LeetCode problems. I've conflated my worth as a programmer with my ability to intuitively solve a Hard LeetCode problem. 

Is there a healthy way of acknowledging this situation? Yes. There is! I don't have to solve problems on LeetCode. That isn't indicative of interview success. I only need to understand the solutions to these Hard problems. Does it matter whether I came up with these solutions on my own? No. Does the interviewer care about the source of my solution? No. They just care about the solution itself. So, why am I trying to reinvent the wheel? It's not necessary. People have solved all these problems in the past. My goal is to understand and learn from these solutions. A happy side effect of this approach is learning new concepts.

So that is going to be my approach. I will change the wording of my goals from "Solve 2 problems on LeetCode" to "Understand and learn solutions to two problems on LeetCode". I hope this change in the internal narrative will make LeetCode more fun. I have no stakes in the solution. I am just there to understand the solutions to these problems. Let the learning begin!
