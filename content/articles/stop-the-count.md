description: Measuring progress works really well... Until it doesn't.

Measurements are essential to recognize progress. Want to know much you've been snacking lately? Compare your current weight with your pre-pandemic weight. Want to know how much more time you're wasting staring at a computer screen now? Look up the trend of your screen time for the past few months. Trends are amazing. They give a bird's eye view of all aspects of life.
  
In an effort to lose some of the weight that I gained from an extended visit to India earlier in the year, I have been running and biking regularly. I use Strava to record my runs. Looking at people's activities on it is really inspiring. And so, for the past few months, I have been religiously recording my runs and bike rides on Strava. Well, for the most part.  
  
Recording my activity on Strava has been a great way to ensure accountability. I feel like I have a responsibility to record my progress on the app. Whenever I am on a run and I want to stop, looking at the numbers on my phone makes me give just that little bit extra. I push myself to the end of the mile or until I hit a PB for the segment. All of this is possible because I track the run.  

I began to notice that I would sometimes not publish my activity if I felt that it was sub-par. If I have been running 2 miles regularly, I would not publish a run that was less than a mile. I felt that it doesn't deserve to go up on my public feed. This was not an issue the first few times. If I wanted to stop running at any point, I would stop the run and not publish it.  

I didn't know why I was doing this. It is odd behavior and I wanted to understand it. I tried to remember what thoughts went through my head when I decided not to publish an activity. Here are a few of those thoughts.  

"This is not what I am capable of. This effort is a false representation of my ability. Why would I publish it?"
"What if the people who look at my Strava post see my low mileage for this run?"
"A 0.5 mile run isn't really a run anyway. Why publish it?"

Yesterday, I was running along my usual route and I started to feel tired. I wanted to stop. I started to feel the weight of yet another sub-mile run that would go unrecorded. I felt demoralized. I stopped running and started to walk. I paused the run hoping to take a small break and continue again. But that didn't happen. I felt like I couldn't go on. I finished the activity on Strava and did not publish it. My head was bowed. My specs were fogged over from running with a mask. My shins hurt. In that moment, I felt like I had lost an important personal battle. If you asked me why I felt that way, I couldn't tell you. I still can't. In less than thirty seconds, physically, I felt fine. But mentally, I was not. I thought about walking the rest of the 2 mile loop and then heading home. If ever there was a walk of defeat, this was it. 

At that moment, something magical happened. Something changed and I started to run. I ran for a quarter mile and walked for a bit. I ran again. Soon, I had reached the lake that marks the turnaround point for my run. I didn't stop. I ran ahead.  A little while later, I had run farther than I ever had. I didn't even consider recording this run on Strava. I felt free. This run was for me. Not for Shreyas Shankar's Strava profile. This was for the guy who couldn't run more than half a mile without needing to walk. I ran and I walked. And I ran some more. I was out on the trail for a good two hours. I must have covered at least 4 miles. Granted, a good chunk of it was walking. But I didn't care. I felt really good. 

Looking back at this event, I noticed how hesitant I was to have any record of my failure. Even with something as inconsequential as a Strava activity, I could not allow myself to record a failure. When I continued the run, there was still the probability of failure. But I just took away the probability of a record of failure.

I've spent my entire life assuming that everyone in the world walks around with The Scroll of Shreyas' Failures and their job is to record, talk about and humiliate me for every failure. I guess the world does not revolve around me. If there is a scroll it is The Scroll of Shreyas' Successes. And maybe it should be the latter scroll that I should care about. Looking to avoid failures is a sure way of ensuring that I have no successes. 

Another interesting aspect of this experience is the nature of social media. Why did the prospect of measuring my run and publishing it for the world make me feel so miserable? Strava is the only social media that I am active on. I don't have any sense of community on that app. I barely know the people that I follow on there and yet the pressure to appear perfect, on a platform that I don't really care about, was not insubstantial. I can't imagine how wrecked I would be if I was fishing for likes on Instagram and looking at my retweet count on Twitter.

Social Media is best fed by people showcasing their interests. The best posts showcase creations that would have been created even if social media did not exist. We have added insecurity and a craving for approval that is taking away from the joy of creation. I stand by my decision to stay away from social media. I will no longer censor my feed. My runs are for me. All my runs have value. Even the ones where I only run half a mile.
