I took a week off between jobs. I spent three days in Monterey during that time and loved every minute of it. It was time spent with myself and I barely spoke to another soul during my time there. I barely stexted anyone and spent the entire time on the beach. I came home with a wide smile on my face and wide sunburns on my arms. Monterey was a blast.

After spending two whole days on the beach in Monterey I couldn't bring myself to do a third day there. I decided to spend the third day in Carmel and then head home. I checked out of my hotel and started driving to Carmel. I knew that Pebble Beach was near Carmel but didn't know that Pebble Beach was actually a small golf town and not just a beach. So I routed to Pebble Beach and that, unfortunately, took me to 17 Mile Drive.

Now, I've been to 17 Mile Drive in the past. It's the go-to location to take those friends who're visiting the Bay Area. I found myself at the first stop on 17 Mile Drive at 10 in the morning. I had paid $10 for the entry and I was somewhat irritated. It was not my intention to end up in 17 Mile Drive, but now that I was there, I put on my Anton Ego hat and decided to review this drive out of existence.

(I should mention that I ended up taking this way more seriously than I intended and spent about 5 hours stopping at each spot and thinking about what would be a fair rating)

Let's begin our tour of 17 Mile Drive.

<u>Shepherd's Knoll</u> - I spent a whopping 10 minutes. After 10 minutes of intense staring, all I could see were trees. There was nothing here. The Shepherd in Shepherd's Knoll is the name of an old dude who owned this land. Rating: Waste of Time.

<u>Huckleberry Hill</u> - Another stop that promises a lot and delivers nothing. It's a hill that probably makes for a great address but does nothing for a tourist. Rating: Waste of Time.

<u>Spanish Bay</u> - This is my favorite spot along 17 Mile Drive. Spanish Bay more than makes up for the first two disappointments. Spend your time walking along the pristine beach and staring at the magnificent waves and the blue ocean. If the day is sunny, bring a chair or a beach blanket and settle down. It doesn't get any better than this. Rating: Absolutely wonderful.

<u>The Restless Sea</u> - A 30s drive from Spanish Bay. It's a beautiful place with waves crashing into large rocks. The more adventure-minded can try to climb the rocks. I'd give it a high rating if there was a place to sit there (Sigh. I'm turning into an old man). Overall, a great place to stand and contemplate the meaning of life while waves crash endlessly on rocks below you. Rating: Relaxation amidst chaos.

<u>Point Joe</u> - Point Joe is a nice place that's right next to The Restless Sea. I like this place just for the story. The place probably gets its name from an old man named Joe who lived on a hut at the edge of the rocks and sold trinkets to visitors. There is now a swath of well-maintained lawn in the spot where his house once stood. No great views of the sea but you can see some cormorants sunbathing. A pretty cool place. Rating: Would have been perfect if I could go to the little swath of grass and sit on it.

<u>China Rock</u> - Apparently the site of an old Chinese fishing village. Rating: Meh

<u>Bird Rock</u> - A big jutting rock in the water that's usually full of birds. Pretty cool place. Bring binoculars or a camera with good zoom to see these birds. Rating: Pretty cool.

<u>Seal Rock</u> - Closed for visitors when I was there. It is a cubbing ground for seals. It would have been cool if it was open. Rating: N/A

<u>Fanshell Beach Overlook</u> - It was so Meh that I didn't even bother to stop. Rating: Meh*2

</u>Cypress Point Lookout</u> - Delivers what it advertises. I'm happy with this place. Great views of Cypress trees and the Pacific. Rating: Meets Expectations

<u>Crocker Grove</u> - Disappointing place after the majesty of Cypress Point. To be fair to Crocker Grove, it's pretty good on its own, but its placement between Cypress Point Lookout and The Lone Cypress doesn't do it any favors. Rating: You'll spend less time here than it takes to park your car.

<u>The Lone Cypress</u> - One of the most famous spots along 17 miles drive. A lone cypress tree braving the wind and the waves against the backdrop of a roiling ocean. A poetic sight. I stood staring at that tree for a long time. Rating: A sense of solidity in the background of constant change.

<u>Ghost Trees at Pescadero Point</u> - Dead trees that are probably spooky under the right lighting. The name of this spot is a definite win for the Parks PR Team. It still has more value than Shepherd's Knoll. Rating: Interesting

<u>Pebble Beach Visitor Center</u> - Now this place deserves special mention. It's not for the only restroom along 17 Mile Drive. It's not for the overpriced snacks and drinks that you can buy here. The shout-out is for this wonderful cashier who helped me find little spots in Pebble Beach and also recommended a nice cafe for lunch and coffee. She was a wonderful person and that experience alone wins Pebble Beach Visitor Center the runners-up spot place along 17 Mile Drive. (Was this also because I hadn't had a meaningful conversation with another human being for the past 4 days? I'll plead the fifth). Rating: Great person. Great restroom. Overprices stuff.

<u>Pebble Beach Golf Links</u> - I certainly didn't go there to golf. I don't think I could afford it. But I had lunch overlooking the spot where people were teeing off for the first hole and it was a beautiful place. Some day I'm going to come back here to golf. Pro tip: Have a long lunch at any place and eavesdrop on the conversation of rich, old. white people. It's a fascinating experience. Rating: Nothing to do if you're not looking to golf.

<u>Pebble Beach Equestrian Center</u> - No fancy equestrian stuff was going on. Saw a few horses. It was Meh. Rating: Neigghhhhh.

<u>Ford Meadow</u> - A scam if there was ever one. Just a strip of land without trees. If there wasn't a board there you wouldn't look at it twice. Rating: Drive past it. Don't stop.

If you reached the end, well done! I hope this review was useful.
